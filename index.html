    <h1>Precision Crafted Performance</h1>
    <p>Coinciding with its 30th anniversary in 2016, Acura set a new course for its future, turning its focus back to its original and authentic roots as a performance-focused luxury brand. The second-generation Acura NSX launched as the pinnacle expression of Precision Crafted Performance kicking off the brand’s determined focus on a future that was first and foremost about performance.

In 2016, the foundations for a new design language were set with the debut of the Acura Precision Concept. Drawing inspiration from NSX, the Precision Concept adopted a supercar stance and sheer, alluring surfaces that pointed to a bolder more distinctive future for Acura design. The Concept also showcased key new production styling cues, including edgier lines and Acura’s signature new Diamond Pentagon grille, which were quickly adopted across the entire lineup, most recently on the 2019 ILX compact sports sedan.</p>

    <h1>The Electrification Of Premium Performance</h1>
    <p>Stuttgart (Germany) – Mercedes-Benz is getting ready to go all electric by the end of the decade, where market conditions allow. Shifting from electric-first to electric-only, the world’s pre-eminent luxury car company is accelerating toward an emissions-free and software-driven future.

By 2022, Mercedes-Benz will have battery electric vehicles (BEV) in all segments the company serves. From 2025 onwards, all newly launched vehicle architectures will be electric-only and customers will be able to choose an all-electric alternative for every model the company makes. Mercedes-Benz intends to manage this accelerated transformation while sticking to its profitability targets.

“The EV shift is picking up speed - especially in the luxury segment, where Mercedes-Benz belongs. The tipping point is getting closer and we will be ready as markets switch to electric-only by the end of this decade,” said Ola Källenius, CEO of Daimler AG and Mercedes-Benz AG. “This step marks a profound reallocation of capital. By managing this faster transformation while safeguarding our profitability targets, we will ensure the enduring success of Mercedes-Benz. Thanks to our highly qualified and motivated workforce,
I am convinced that we will be successful in this exciting new era.”

To facilitate this shift, Mercedes-Benz is unveiling a comprehensive plan which includes significantly accelerating R&D. In total, investments into battery electric vehicles between 2022 and 2030 will amount to over €40 billion. Accelerating and advancing the EV portfolio plan will bring forward the tipping point for EV adoption.</p>
